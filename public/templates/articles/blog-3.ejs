                        <h1>Six Ways to Whiten Teeth Naturally</h1>
                        <p>
                            Are you one of the 18% of people who feel that they have to cover up their teeth in photos? Teeth are 
                            very noticeable, and if you’&rsquo;e feeling self&ndash;conscious about them, it can stop you smiling &ndash; 
                            and that&rsquo;s a powerful means of communication that you&rsquo;re shutting down.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Thinning enamel, bad gums, yellow or brown stains can all be causes of bad teeth so you may need a lot 
                            more than just cosmetic maintenance. If on the other hand, you have some minor discoloration thanks to 
                            coffee or smoking, there are a handful of ways to try whitening your teeth naturally.
                        </p>

                        <h2>1. Coconut Oil</h2>
                        <p>
                            Some research is showing that a spoonful of coconut oil swished around the mouth/gums for five to twenty 
                            minutes can serve as a natural teeth whitener. You can also just apply the coconut oil to a toothbrush or 
                            the corner of a small hand&ndash;towel that’s rubbed into the teeth.
                        </p>

                        <h2>2. Apple Cider Vinegar</h2>
                        <p>
                            Apple Cider vinegar is a great natural antibiotic and able to remove some stains, especially ones caused 
                            by smoking. The active ingredients include acetic acids which both kill bad germs and nurture the growth 
                            of good bacteria (probiotic). Be aware &ndash; as you should with any acids &ndash; that overuse can harm 
                            the tooth enamel. Whenever you use it, brush with regular toothpaste and rinse your mouth out.
                        </p>

                        <h2>3. Lemon/Orange Peels</h2>
                        <p>
                            Citrus oils are also noted for their cleansing ability &ndash; and this even includes lemon essential oil. 
                            Again, be aware of using these too much or often as their high acid content can corrode the tooth&rsquo;s 
                            enamel. Just as you should with apple cider vinegar, be sure to rinse your mouth after using them.
                        </p>

                        <h2>4. Baking Soda/Hydrogen Peroxide</h2>
                        <p>
                            As an antibacterial agent, Hydrogen Peroxide is very effective at cleaning the mouth from germs. Simply 
                            put together a cup that&rsquo;s half&ndash;water and half&ndash;peroxide, swish it around the mouth for 
                            sixty seconds, then spit. It&rsquo;s also helpful in protecting against gingivitis.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can also add a tiny amount of baking soda to the peroxide to create a paste that aids in removing 
                            plaque from the teeth. Before using this method, brush your teeth first and be sure to make a perfect mix 
                            because too much baking soda can lead to its grittiness scrubbing the enamel from your teeth.
                        </p>

                        <h2>5. Brush More Often</h2>
                        <p>
                            It&rsquo;s simple, but you&rsquo;d be surprised how many people don&rsquo;t brush often enough (or at all!). 
                            Brushing can remove some of the bits of food or drink that can develop into stains.
                        </p>

                        <h2>6. Change Your Diet</h2>
                        <p>
                            Quitting smoking and cutting down on coffee and sodas can help immensely. If you can&rsquo;t stop 
                            completely, use a straw with the drinks. Drinking water after eating/drinking something that can stain your 
                            teeth also helps.
                        </p>

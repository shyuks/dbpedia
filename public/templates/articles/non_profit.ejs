                        <h2>Smiles For Life</h2>
                        <p><strong>Website</strong>: <a href="http://www.smilesforlife.org" target="_blank">http://www.smilesforlife.org</a></p>
                        <p><strong>What They Do</strong>: From March through June every year, literally hundreds of Dentists across the country and Canada who are members of the Crown Council offer reduced prices on teeth whitening. They then take 100% of these costs and donate them to the Smiles For Life foundation. That money then goes to ill, disabled and/or underprivileged kids the world over.</p>
                        <p><strong>How You Can Use Them</strong>: You can get involved by using these dentists during this time for a major discount on teeth whitening procedures. You can find out who those dentists are by using this link.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reliability</strong>: They&rsquo;re a legitimate operation that&rsquo;s raised over $38 million dollars since launching in 1998.</p>
                        <h2>UAB School Of Dentistry</h2>

                        <p><strong>What They Do</strong>: It&rsquo;s a University, so the students get to practice on your teeth for a discount (while under the direct supervision of faculty). They have three separate clinical programs that encompass everything from teeth whitening to extraction.</p>
                        <p><strong>How You Can Use Them</strong>: You can get involved by getting on their schedule and having your teeth seen too!</p>
                        <p><strong>Reliability</strong>: They&rsquo;re a legitimate operation, but as with many School programs, it&rsquo;s generally first-come, first-served, so you&rsquo;ll have to schedule an appointment and get there very early.</p>
